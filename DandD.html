			<th>Dragonborn</th>
			<td class="left">Dragonborn look very similar to their namesake with the
                exception of the lack of wings or a tail. The first Dragonborn were said
                to be devout worshippers of Bahamut that were gifted with the characteristics
                of their deity. In any case, they are now a self sufficient race born
                from eggs. They have strong clan loyalties and are a proud, dignified race.
                They know the Common Tongue and Draconic languages. <br/>

			<th>Dwarf</th>
			<td class="left">Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners,
                and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall,
                dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human
                standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also
                easily a match for any of the larger folk. Like the rock they live so
                closely with, they are stubborn and resistant to change. They know the 
                Common Tongue and Dwarvish languages.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>
                <strong>Darkvison</strong>: Having spent much of their lives underground,
                Dwarves are able to see in little to no light.<br/>
                <strong>Poison Resistance</strong>: Dwarves are hardy and gain a +2 bonus
                to Fortitude rolls against poison and disease.<br/>
                <strong>Metalworking</strong>: Dwarves are very familiar with the mechanics
                of locks and simple mechanisms, allowing them to pick locks and set and disarm
                traps <span id="metalWorking"></span>.

			<th>Elf</th>
			<td class="left">Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
                perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more
                deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be
                curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
                happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a
                mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and
                relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower
                to forget them. Elves speak the Common Tongue and Elvish.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>
                <strong>Darkvison</strong>: Elves have spent many nights using just the
                moonlight that gets through the forest canopy to see, and as such can see in
                very dim lighting.<br/>
                <strong>Trance</strong>: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate
                deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this
                way, they gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br/>
                <strong>Insightful</strong>: Elves gain a +1 bonus to perception.

            <td class="left">A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through
                every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet
                tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually
                adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their
                bright eyes shine with excitement. They are a very curious and impulsive
                race, though meticulous about things they deem important. Quick to laugh
                at jokes and at their own expense, gnomes are generally a kind-hearted
                people. Gnomes speak the Common Tongue plus one other language.<br/>

                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>

			<th>Halfling</th>
			<td class="left">Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. The comforts
                of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in
                peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies.
                Adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of
                community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity rather than the desire
                for power and wealth that drives many other adventurers. They’re
                concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use
                for ostentation. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward
                solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering. Though
                they are characterized as mild, they can display remarkable ferocity
                when their friends, families, or communities are threatened. Halflings
                know the Common Tongue.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>
                <strong>Small Stature</strong>: Halflings are considered a Small unit,

                <strong>Lucky</strong>: If you roll a 1 using the d20, reroll it and take
                the new roll.<br/>
                <strong>Wily</strong>: Halflings can move through squares occupied by
                Large size or larger units.

			<th>Half-Orc</th>
			<td class="left">Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or
                having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human
                tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to
                the terror of civilized lands nearby. As could be expected to happen
                during long periods of intermingling, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs
                rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving
                them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the
                world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races.
                Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws,
                prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain
                for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually
                weigh between 180 and 250 pounds. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but
                they feel the savagery of their orc heritage within them. They speak the
                Common Tongue and Orcish languages.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>
                <strong>Fearless</strong>: Half-orcs gain a +3 bonus to Will saves
                against being Frightened.<br/>
                <strong>Aggressive</strong>: Half-orcs gain a +3 bonus to Charisma checks
                being used to intimidate.

			<th>Human</th>
			<td class="left">Humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive
                on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to the other races.
                Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve
                as much as they can in the years they are given. Whatever drives them,
                humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.
                With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically
                diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. Humans are
                the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have
                widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands
                where they have settled. As a very diverse people, humans are generally
                more accepting of other races, and are more accepted themselves because
                of that. Humans speak the Common Tongue plus one more language.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Abilities</u></strong><br/>
                <strong>Chosen Specialty</strong>: Humans are a diverse people who choose
                their own path. Human characters have two more stat points to spend at
                Level 1.
